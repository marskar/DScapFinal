# Next Word prediction app info

I made this Shiny app as part of the Capstone Project of the 
[Coursera Data Science 
Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience), created by Roger Peng, Jeff Leek and Brian Caffo of Johns Hopkins University. The Data Science Specialization Capstone is a collaboration with [Swiftkey](http://swiftkey.com/).


##  How do I use the app?



## What's under the hood?



## GitHub Repository

The code for obtaining and processing the data and running the app (shiny server.r and ui.r files) are available at this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/marskar/DScapFinal).

## Modify the app

To rebuild the app on your own machine, you will need to first download the data, process it and create .rds files using the DScapstoneReportMWS.Rmd, WordPredAlgo.Rmd and ngram_tokenizer.R files. Then open the server.r and ui.r files in Rstudio and click run app. The all files depend on the tm package. To run the shiny app, you will need the shiny and markdown packages.
